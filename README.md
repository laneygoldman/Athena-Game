# Athena-Game
This is a game project I made for my 9th grade Java class.

## Concept
This game is based off of Lockheed Martin's [ATHENA laser weapon system](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2019-11-07-ATHENA-Successfully-Defends-Drone-Threat). In the game, you are controlling the laser weapon system and trying to shoot down enemy drones. This is just for fun and not affiliated with Lockheed Martin in any way.
