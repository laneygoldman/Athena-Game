# Athena-Game
This is the game project I made for my 9th grade Java class.

## Concept
This game is based off of [Lockheed Martin's ATHENA laser weapon system.](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2019-11-07-ATHENA-Successfully-Defends-Drone-Threat). In the game, you are controlling the laser weapon system and trying to shoot down enemy drones. Each level is based on a different testing site from the program. 

## Play the Game
Simply run AthenaProject.java to launch the applet. Then, click "How to Play" for furthur instructions.
